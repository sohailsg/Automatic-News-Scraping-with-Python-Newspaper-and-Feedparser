To solve this problem, we can use the Python programming language, along with the Newspaper and Feedparser modules. The Newspaper module is a powerful tool for extracting and parsing news articles from various sources, while the Feedparser module is useful for parsing RSS feeds. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. These updates can include blog entries, news articles, audio, video, and any other content that can be provided in a feed.

Required Module

pip install newspaper3k
pip install feedparser
First, we import the required modules newspaper, and feedparser. Next, we define a function called 
scrape_news_from_feed() which takes a feed URL as input. Inside the function, we first parse the RSS 
feed using the feedparser.parse() method. This returns a dictionary containing various information about the feed and its entries.

Create a newspaper article object using the newspaper.Article() constructor and passing it the link of the article.

Then download and parse the article using the article.download() and article.parse() methods. Extract relevant information
such as the title, author, publish date, and main content of the article. Append this information
to a list of articles. Finally, the function returns the list of articles.
